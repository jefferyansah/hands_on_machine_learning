# Hands on Machine Learining


* In lay man terms, machine learning is art and science of programming computers so that they can learn from data.
Machine learning tries to allow the  computer to learn without having to explicitly write  all the logic and instructions to the computer for the computer.


When do we say a machine is learning : A computer is said to have learn from experience `E` with respect to a task `T` and some performance measure `P`, its performance `P` on task `T` with improves with experience.

A training example is called an instance.

Applying ML techinuques to dig into data to uncover patterns that are not immediately present is called data mining.


* Four Main Areas where machine learning is really useful 
 	1. In problems where it is required for humans to write a long list of rules.
 	2. In domains where the data is constantly changing
 	3. In a complex problem where the manual solution is not good at all.
 	4. Gather Insights about a complex problem and large amounts of data.


Categories of Machine Leanring:

1. Cateogry based on the amount and type of supervsion they get during training: Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-supervised, Reinforcement Learning.

2. Approach of Learning: Online (learning on the fly) versus Batch

3. Mode of Operation: Instance based or Model based


Instance Baseed vrs Model Based Learning:

* Instance based learning also known as learning by heart. In ML Models can be classified on how they generalized to on training exampls to solve  a problem. In Instance based learning the model finds similiarties between the new instances and the example instances in the traning set. This is also known as learning by heart.

* In model based learning the a model is created based on examples in the training set.  You can define a utility function or fitness function that measure how good your model is or a cost function to measure how bad your model is.


* over fitting happends when the model is too complex relative to the amount of noise of the training data.
